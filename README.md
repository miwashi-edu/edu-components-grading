### üìö Instructions

#### ü¶∂ Scaffold Project

```bash
cd ~
cd ws
cd components-grading
mkdir -p ./src/components/Sample
touch ./src/components/Sample/index.js
touch ./src/components/Sample/Sample.jsx
touch ./src/components/Sample/Sample.module.css
touch ./src/components/Sample/Sample.styles.js
touch ./src/components/Sample/Sample.stories.jsx
```

#### ü¶∂ Component <heredoc

```bash
cat > ./src/components/Sample/Sample.jsx << 'EOF'
import React from 'react';

const Sample = () => {
  return(
    <>Sample</>
  );
}

export default Sample;
EOF
```

#### ü¶∂ Storybook <heredoc

> [`Component Story Format`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/csf) (`CSF`)

```bash
cat > ./src/components/Sample/Sample.stories.jsx << 'EOF'
import {React} from 'react';
import Sample from '.';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Sample',
  component: Sample,
}

export const Default = {
}
EOF
```

#### ü¶∂ Barrel File <heredoc

```bash
cat > ./src/components/Sample/index.js << 'EOF'
export {default as Sample} from './Sample";
EOF
```

#### ü¶∂ Add help bundler find file from components, and src

```bash
cat > ./src/components/index.js << 'EOF'
export {Sample} from './components/Sample";

cat > ./src/index.js << 'EOF'
export {Sample} from './components";
EOF
```

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Try it

```
npm run storybook
```


#### üîÑ Repeat trail

```bash
git reset --hard
git clean -df
```

#### ‚úÖ End trail

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Sample component done"
```

## Bonus (not part of tutorial)

```bash
cat > ./src/info.mdx <<
# Welcome to components-grading
## Yellow belt

On this level, we will learn to scaffold a component.

A software component is a modular unit of software that encapsulates specific functionality. The desired characteristics of a component are reusability and maintainability.
By treating the component as a small system, we can make it robust, long-living, and reusable.

### File List:

- **index.js**
: It helps the bundler locate and load your components.

- **Component.mdx**
: The documentation file, which should describe the component‚Äôs functionality and usage.

- **Component.jsx**
: The component file, which should have a single responsibility and export the component by default for the bundler to locate.

- **Component.module.css**
: It is scoped to the component and uses its own namespace, preventing CSS collision.

- **Component.styles.js**
: It contains dynamic styles, *CSS-in-JS* and, while slower than .css, can offer more flexibility. It is typically used less frequently, but the file must exist for quality even when not used.

- **Component.stories.js**
: It contains test stories for your component, designed to test its robustness. If the component passes all tests without issues, it has succeeded.

**To grade yourself `Yellow Belt`, you should complete this task in 5 minutes using only Vim and a terminal.**. Grading must be performed before a `black belt`.
