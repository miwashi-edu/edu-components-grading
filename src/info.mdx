# Welcome to components-grading

## White belt
On this level, we will set up the basic foundation for component development.

## Yellow belt

On this level, we will learn to scaffold a component.

A software component is a modular unit of software that encapsulates specific functionality. The desired characteristics of a component are reusability and maintainability.
By treating the component as a small system, we can make it robust, long-living, and reusable.

### File List:

- **index.js**
: It helps the bundler locate and load your components.

- **Component.mdx**
: The documentation file, which should describe the componentâ€™s functionality and usage.

- **Component.jsx**
: The component file, which should have a single responsibility and export the component by default for the bundler to locate.

- **Component.module.css**
: It is scoped to the component and uses its own namespace, preventing CSS collision.

- **Component.styles.js**
: It contains dynamic styles, *CSS-in-JS* and, while slower than .css, can offer more flexibility. It is typically used less frequently, but the file must exist for quality even when not used.

- **Component.stories.js**
: It contains test stories for your component, designed to test its robustness. If the component passes all tests without issues, it has succeeded.

**To grade yourself `Yellow Belt`, you should complete this task in 4 minutes using only Vim and a terminal.**. Grading must be performed before a `black belt`.
