# Welcome to components-grading

## White belt
On this level, we will set up the basic foundation for component development.

## Yellow belt

On this level, we will learn to scaffold a component.

A software component is a modular unit of software that encapsulates specific functionality. The desired characteristics of a component are reusability and maintainability.
By treating the component as a small system, we can make it robust, long-living, and reusable.

### File List:

- **index.js**:
It helps the bundler locate and load your components.

- **Component.mdx**:
The documentation file, which should describe the componentâ€™s functionality and usage.

- **Component.jsx**:
The component file, which should have a single responsibility and export the component by default for the bundler to locate.

- **Component.module.css**:
It is scoped to the component and uses its own namespace, preventing CSS collision.

- **Component.styles.js**:
It contains dynamic styles, *CSS-in-JS*, and, while slower than `.css`, can offer more flexibility. It is typically used less frequently, but the file must exist for quality even when not used.

- **Component.stories.js**:
It contains test stories for your component, designed to test its robustness. If the component passes all tests without issues, it has succeeded.

**To grade yourself `Yellow Belt`, you should complete this task in 4 minutes using only Vim and a terminal.** Grading must be performed before a `black belt`.

## Orange belt

On this level, we will focus on **creating a component that uses both CSS Modules and CSS-in-JS for styling**.

You will learn how to **combine static styles (via CSS Modules)** and **dynamic styles (via CSS-in-JS)** in a single component. This approach allows for flexible and maintainable styling, while keeping styles modular and scoped to the component.

At this level, you will:

- Use **CSS Modules** for static, scoped styles that prevent conflicts.
- Use **CSS-in-JS** for dynamic styling based on props or other component logic.

**To grade yourself `Orange Belt`, you should complete this task in 6 minutes using only Vim and a terminal.**
