# Styled Component Documentation

## Overview
The `Styled` component demonstrates how to use **CSS Modules** and **CSS-in-JS** together in a React component. It applies scoped styles using a CSS Module for static styles and **CSS-in-JS** for dynamic styles based on props.

This component also includes **prop validation** using a **guard clause**. If the `text` prop is not a string, it logs an error to the console and displays an error message in the UI. This is useful for ensuring that the component behaves predictably and doesn't render incorrect content when invalid props are passed.

The component also **"talks"** to the user by visually communicating issues. Instead of silently failing, it renders an error message when an invalid prop is provided, improving the user experience. While `console.log` or `console.error` is helpful during development, it is recommended to replace them with more user-friendly error handling or feedback mechanisms in production.

### Why I Don't Use `Prop-Types` or TypeScript

In this project, I have opted not to use **`prop-types`** or **TypeScript** for a few reasons:

1. **Visual Components**:
The components here are primarily **visual** (focused on UI and styling), and the type validation or strict typing isn't always necessary for the design process. The focus is on **user interface** rather than **data management**.

2. **Storybook**:
**Storybook** serves as an effective tool for visualizing and testing components in isolation. It provides a robust interface for seeing how components behave with various props, so I donâ€™t feel the need to enforce strict typing with TypeScript or `prop-types`. Storybook's interactive environment allows me to test how components react to different inputs quickly.

3. **CI/CD and Tests**:
The project relies on **CI/CD pipelines** that include **automated tests**, ensuring that the components behave as expected in all scenarios. I prefer to validate the behavior through tests rather than adding the additional complexity of TypeScript or `prop-types`. This way, I can write tests to check the behavior of components and ensure they function correctly.

4. **Simplicity Over Complexity**:
While `prop-types` and TypeScript are useful in many cases, I believe they introduce more **overhead** and **complexity** than benefit in this scenario. I prefer to keep the workflow simpler and focus on what matters most for UI components: **visual consistency** and **behavior** through testing and Storybook.

### Conclusion
By combining **Storybook**, **CI/CD** with tests, and a **simple error handling** approach, I can ensure that components are reliable and maintainable without the extra fuzz of TypeScript or `prop-types`. This approach helps me focus on **design** and **user experience** without getting bogged down by additional tooling and type-checking overhead.

## Code

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import styles from './Styled.module.css';
import { dynamicStyles } from './Styled.styles.js';

const Styled = ({ text, fontSize }) => {

  // Guard clause for invalid prop types
  if (typeof text !== 'string') {
    console.error("Invalid prop type: `text` should be a string.");
    return <div className={styles.errorText}>Invalid text prop provided!</div>;
  }

  // Dynamic styling based on the fontSize prop
  const dynamicStyle = dynamicStyles(fontSize);

  // Inspect the tags in the browser and see how styles.StyledContainer are renamed to ensure scoping.
  return (
    <div className={styles.StyledContainer}>
      <div className={styles.StyledText} style={dynamicStyle.dynamicText}>
        CSS Module + CSS-in-JS Styled: {text}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Styled;
